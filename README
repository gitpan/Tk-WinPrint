This is a port of the tkwinprint package for Tcl/Tk on Windows
systems. It provides methods for printing from Tk::Text and Tk::Canvas
widgets.

Works only with gcc (mingw32 or cygwin)!

Since I don't have a Windows system anymore and really do not do
Windows hacking, I would like to see this module adopted by a
"champion". Making this work for ActiveState Perl would be task no. 1.
